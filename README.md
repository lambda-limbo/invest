# Invest

A market simulation platform.

## Prerequisites

If you desire to run the application you just need to have 

- PHP
- Apache
- MySQL configured with the settings of the project (see `database` for more info.)

Then just make Apache serve the public folder and enjoy!

If you desire to run with DOcker keep in mind that this isn't ready and is 
outdated, I will have a look at docker later in the project. *Docker* is 
needed in order to make an isolated environment that will expose the 80 port to accept 
requests. Everything that's is needed is installed there.
