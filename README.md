# Invest

A market simulation platform.

## Prerequisites

If you desire to run the application you just need to have 

- PHP
- Apache
- MySQL configured with the settings of the project (see the `database` folder for more info.)

Then just make Apache serve the public folder and enjoy!

If you desire to run with Docker keep in mind that this isn't ready and is 
outdated, I will have a look at docker later in the project. *Docker* is 
needed in order to make an isolated environment that will expose the 80 port to accept 
requests. Everything that's is needed is installed there.
